## ⬇Instructions to Implement Front-end Web App:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the required dependacies and packages. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## ⬇Instructions to Implement Back-end Server:

In the project directory, run:

### `$pip install -a`

Install all the required dependacies and packages.

### `flask run` or `app.run()`

Runs the server in development mode.\

The server is hosted on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
Where, you can view the requests and route calls made from front-end to back-end.\
You may also see any errors in flask console.
